            <p>My name is Erika Ellsmere. I just recently turned 26 at the start of September and this is my third (fourth?) time attending a post-secondary education program after graduating from university with a BA, NSCC's Baking and Pastry Arts program, and AMCA which I took as an unofficial pre-requisite to Graphic Design.</p>
